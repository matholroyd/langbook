How to build in Spaced Repetition support:

A user has many Flash cards.  Flash cards have a next repetition date, which is when that card should be repeated. Flash cards are sorted into decks. A user has many decks.

The system should remember what cards need to be recalled when a user first logs in.

The system has reference to many eBooks.
