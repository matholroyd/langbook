Things learnt:
- Language learning to a sufficient level (e.g. conversational) is long and hard
  - There are no silver bullets to language learning, despite the hype
  - That said, there are some real stand out techniques
    - spaced repetition
    - focus on most frequent words/grammar/expression
- When learning is self directed, discipline is biggest problem
  - Overcoming waning disciple is the key to having fruitful learning
- Content and focus is important for formal training
  - Have had very poor experience where vocab is arbitrary/not directed and grammar is ignored
  - Typical problem when teachers are not formally trained in language acquisition  
  - Should learn most frequent (e.g. useful) words/expressions/grammar rules first
- Tricks I've learnt is to have a wide spectrum of material/situations to master/practice
  - Entertaining vs grammar vs own interest vs necessary
  - Reading vs writing vs speaking vs listening
- Reading + writing + speaking are 3 easiest areas (since can 'prepare' and/or take your time)
- Listening is hardest, since often don't have a choice in 
  a) the content 
  b) the pace 
  c) pronunciation
